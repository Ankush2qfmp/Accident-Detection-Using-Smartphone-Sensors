Research shows smartphones are a practical, low-cost platform for accident and fall detection because they already include accelerometers, gyroscopes and GPS and are widely available.
 
Most studies use the 3-axis accelerometer (for impact/magnitude) plus gyroscope (for orientation/roll) and GPS (for location/context). Sensor fusion improves detection accuracy compared to single-sensor approaches. 

Two main families appear in the literature: simple threshold / rule-based detectors (fast, lightweight) and ML classifiers (SVM, ANN, RNN, decision trees) that reduce false alarms and handle complex patterns. Hybrid pipelines (threshold prefilter → ML classifier) are common. 

There is a shortage of large, realistic smartphone crash datasets; many papers evaluate on small lab-collected or simulated events. This leads to variability in reported accuracy and difficulties in cross-study comparison. Recent efforts publish larger curated smartphone sensor datasets to address this. 
Accuracy, precision/recall (or F1), false positive rate, detection latency, and energy consumption are the usual metrics. Trade-offs exist: higher sensitivity often raises false positives, so systems tune for acceptable operational ranges.

Real-world issues include phone placement variability (pocket, dash, seat), power consumption (continuous sensing), connectivity for alerts, and privacy of location/sensor logs. False positives (e.g., hard braking vs crash) remain a leading challenge. 

Successful prototypes combine automated detection with immediate SMS/GSM or cloud-based notifications to emergency contacts or services, sometimes linking to nearest hospitals — but real deployments need regulatory and system-integration work

(1) richer datasets collected in realistic conditions, (2) on-device ML models optimized for battery and latency, (3) multi-modal fusion (inertial + GPS + audio), and (4) end-to-end trials with emergency services to validate impact on response times.
